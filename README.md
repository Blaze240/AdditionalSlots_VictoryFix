# Additional Slots Victory Fix (Smashline 2)

Skyline plugin modifying certain characters' audio on victory screens when utilizing added slots to play as intended, as without this plugin they will remain mute.

The following characters are fixed in this plugin:
* Ike
* Pokemon Trainer
* Wii Fit Trainer
* Robin
* Corrin
* Byleth

Note that this plugin specifically is coded to follow the costume distribution of the base game, so any deviations (ie stacking multiple male slots in succession and vice versa) will result in mismatched audio.

Smashline 1 and Smashline 2 versions available.
## Prerequesites
